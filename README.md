# The Definitive Guide to Playing Boktai

Since a lot of the information on how to play Boktai is wrong, outdated and all over the place, this Guide aims to provide a centralized place for all information on how to play Boktai and how to solve the problems you might encounter.

Currently we are at the very start of the project. A lot of the actual content is still missing since we are currently doing the technical setup, outlining the content and gathering which information is most important.

Once the guide is mostly finished, we might look into translating it into other languages.
